INSTRUCTIONS:
Amigo will go to the meeting point (0,0,0 in testlab) and ask for a task.
In README_SPEECH_POSSIBILITIES you can find the possible sentences, 
object classes, location classes, objects and locations that can be used
for the specific map.
Amigo should give feedback during getting the action. At the moment he will
try to get the action directly two times, then he will try to get the action
in steps. This takes more time, but will get the right action.

Please give feedback about speech interpreter. If you might think it should
be different.
