    rosrun challenge_egpsr egpsr.py _start_loc:=1  (robotics_lab_B: In hallway, at start position 0,0,0)
    or
    rosrun challenge_egpsr egpsr.py _start_loc:=2  (robotics_lab_B: In living_room, in corner looking at control table)
    or
    rosrun challenge_egpsr egpsr.py _start_loc:=3  (robotics_lab_B: In workshop, looking at robotics_testlab_A)

    - Change arm.
    rosrun challenge_egpsr egpsr.py _arm:=left

    or 

    rosrun challenge_egpsr egpsr.py _arm:=right   !!! WATCH CAREFULLY DURING RIGHT ARM MOVEMENTS, needs to be checked !!!

    (both possible: 
    rosrun challenge_egpsr egpsr.py _start_loc:=3 _arm:=right
    or 
    rosrun challenge_egpsr egpsr.py _arm:=right _start_loc:=3)

INSTRUCTIONS:
Amigo will go to the initial position (meeting point) and ask for a task.
In README_SPEECH_POSSIBILITIES you can find the possible sentences, 
object classes, location classes, objects and locations that can be used
for the specific map.
Amigo should give feedback during getting the action. At the moment he will
try to get the action directly two times. 

Please give feedback about speech interpreter. If you might think it should
be different.
