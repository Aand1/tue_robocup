Amigo is a bartender. He wants to get as many tokens as possible and thus he hands out drinks.
There are 4 main positions: 
 - storage table, where he gets new, full drinks. (In the lab, this is the ikea cabinet)
 - These are brought to the ordering table, where people can get their drinks (In the lab, this is the table naxt to the black cabinet)
 - pickup table, where people dump their empty cans (The table with the PC)
 - trashbin, where amigo dumps the cans picked up at the pickup table (The trashbin near the glass)

The locations must be defined in tue_knowledge/prolog/locations.pl
