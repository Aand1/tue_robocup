### STARTUP:

amigo1:
    1. ahardware

amigo1:
    2. amiddle

Place amigo on start position 
(rwc2015 = start position unknown??) 
(robotics testlabs = in front of virtual door)

### HOW TO TEST:

Run speech generator to get several sentences that amigo should be able to hear:
    3. rosrun challenge_gpsr generate_random_sentence.py

This file can be re-executed to get new sentence.
Sentences can sometimes be unclear or not logic. Please mention in test report.

Then run on the same amigo pc:
    4. rosrun challenge_gpsr gpsr.py amigo

The robot will drive to the meeting point and say "What can I do for you?" and then you can say your sentence.

!!! Please mention in your test results how many times amigo was able to understand you !!!
!!! Also mention weird actions to say to the robot !!!


Testing finding person of the challenge
-----------------------------
Position amigo in a room where he should find a person

$ roscd challenge_gpsr/src/challenge_gpsr/
$ amigo-console
>>> from gpsr import *
>>> test_find_person(amigo,'hallway') # 'hallway' can also be another room.
