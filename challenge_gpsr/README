### HOW TO TEST:

Currently the gpsr challenge is under construction.
For now only the sentences can be tested.

Run speech generator to get sentence that amigo should be able to hear:
3. rosrun challenge_gpsr speech_generator.py

This file can be re-executed to get new sentence.
Sentences can sometimes be unclear or not logic. Please mention in test report.

Then run the challenge. Amigo will say "Say it" and then you can say your sentence. 
Please mention in your test results how many times amigo was able to understand you.
