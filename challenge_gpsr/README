### HOW TO TEST:

Run speech generator to get several sentences that amigo should be able to hear:

This file can be re-executed to get new sentence.
Sentences can sometimes be unclear or not logic. Please mention in test report.

Then run on the same amigo pc:
    4. rosrun swi_prolog swipl_server

Amigo will say "What can I do for you?" and then you can say your sentence.
