During a real competition:
On the dev PC:
    sshamigo3 #This will not work because amigo is unplugged

During the challenge: 
    - The robot enters the arena
    - The robot will (try to) go to the first waypoint (dinner_table) and finally say whether it reached its goal or not. The idea of this challenge is to demonstrate flexibility of the navigation: if one path appears to be blocked, the robot should be able to either replan or clear the way to its goal. So don't be easy on the navigation! Block a (few) paths to test this!
    - The robot will (try to) go to the second waypoint (black_cabinet2) and finally say whether it reached its goal or not. Again, you may want to block a path to test the navigation.
    - After this message the robot will go to the exit

During a real competition:
    - Plug the network cable back in
    - The sshamigo3 will connect
    - type 'hear continue' in the sshamigo3 console.
