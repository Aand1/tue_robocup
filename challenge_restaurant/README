    rosrun challenge_restaurant restaurant_simple

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Make sure the operator is standing in front of the robot. After saying 'Can you please show me the locations', AMIGO starts following
- If you want the robot to stop, say: 'Amigo stop', confirm and answer with 'This location is called <some name>' (or some other location name), AMIGO confirms and continues following
- If AMIGO lost the operator it will say so. It expects the operator to come stand in front of him.



With GMAPPING:

amigo1:

    amiddle-follow-me nav:=true localization:=true gmapping:=true wire_frame:=base_link
    
amigo3:
    rosrun challenge_restaurant restaurant_gmap
    
INSTRUCTIONS:
- Make sure the operator is standing in front of the robot. After saying 'Can you please show me the locations', AMIGO starts following
- If you want the robot to stop, say: 'Amigo stop', confirm and answer with 'This location is called <some name>' (see below), AMIGO confirms and continues following
- If AMIGO lost the operator it will say so. It expects the operator to come stand in front of him.

It will be hardcoded that Amigo will call the first location the ordering location, and the next five locations, he will call : Location, Place, Dropoff, Spot and Room. And in that sequence.
So it does not matter what you say to the robot as long as you will say This Location is named or This location is called after you stopped amigo with amigo-stop.
