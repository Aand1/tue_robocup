GUIDING PHASE:
- The guide should stand in front of the robot, then the robot starts following. If the robot turns pink, he lost the guide, stand in front of the robot.
- You must learn three delivery locations, a kitchen shelf and a bar shelf. 
- Say 'one right' if the first delivery location is on AMIGO's right. Or for example kitchen front (front means location 0.5 m in front of AMIGO) if the kitchen shelf is in front of AMIGO. If you only give a location name AMIGO assumes that he should remember the left side.
- AMIGO asks for confirmation (yes/no). If you instead say continue, AMIGO will continue following without storing the location
- When you are at the ordering location, say 'order' and confirm (no side needed)

ORDERING
- AMIGO first asks for a delivery location (one, two, three), answer and confirm
- AMIGO then asks for an object. If two objects should go to this location, you can answer with both objects
- Repeat until three orders are specified

DELIVERY
- Now AMIGO will deliver the objects
- After delivering all objects AMIGO returns to the ordering location
