During the challenge:
    - The robot enters the arena
    - It will (try to) go to the first waypoint (room entrance) and it will wait for the Operator to stand in front of him
    - After he sees someone in front the robot will ask the person's name and learn his/her face
    - When the learning is complete the robot will ask the Operator to go to the living room and mix with the crowd, so go....
    - The robot will navigate between waypoints in the living room trying to find a crowd or at least a person
    - He will move to the crowd and try to find the Operator by pointing at him
    - Finally the robot has to describe the crowd, saying how many males and females are present as well as their pose
    - when this is all done the robot will move to the exit

UPDATE: So far if the robot does not find the crowd he wont give up and will enter a loop searching. So he if he doesn't find anyone within +/- 5 attemps you can stop.
