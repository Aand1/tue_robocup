     Amigo is first guided around the apartment. 
     The environment is mapped and semantically annotated. Objects are bar, table, kitchenblock, trashbin.
     Then, Amigo is instructed to go to on of the newly learned objects (e.g. the bar).
     Once there, the object is moved, Amigo tracks it, and is instructed to go tho the bar again.
     Because the object is tracked, Amigo know where to move again.
     Then, Amigo is instructed to grasp something from the table and then to drop that object in the trashbin (which is also newly learned)
