    (You can store and restore alsamixer settings with 'sudo alsactl store 0' and 'sudo alsactl restore 0', where 0 is the sound card number)
    alsamixer
        Mic Boost -> 22
        Capture -> 44
        Digital -> 29
        Mic on mute!!! (Should be muted already)
        
    amigo-console        
	test_audio()
        (lights should become green -> say 'continue')
        (if response is 'true', amigo heard you and lights become blue)

    SWITCH OFF THE MICROPHONE with the switch on the back 
        (Audio works, but we want to test the challenge for the case the speech doesn't work and the backup scenario.)

    say test  
        (to test speaker is working) 

    rosrun challenge_rips rips.py _arm:=left

    or 

    rosrun challenge_rips rips.py _arm:=right   !!! WATCH CAREFULLY DURING RIGHT ARM MOVEMENTS AT INTRODUCTION, need to be checked !!!

    hear continue #Don't pree enter just yet

if tue_pocket_sphinx crashes
    then launch on amigo3

	roslaunch amigo_launch_files speech_recognition.launch

Unplug the network cable in amigo.
localhost:
    sshamigo3 #Thsi will not work because amigo is unplugged

During the challenge: 
    - Amigo drives to some position and then says it will wait for 'continue' to be said. The mic is off, so we will show the backup scenario.
    - Plug the network cable back in
    - The sshamigo3 will connect
    - type 'hear continue' in the sshamigo3 console.
