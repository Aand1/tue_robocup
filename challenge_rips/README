Unplug the network cable in amigo.

    sshamigo3 #This will not work because amigo is unplugged

During the challenge: 
    - Amigo drives to some position and then says it will wait for 'continue' to be said. The mic is off, so we will show the backup scenario.
    - Plug the network cable back in
    - The sshamigo3 will connect
    - type 'hear continue' in the sshamigo3 console.
