    Human assisted geometric, semantic mapping ...

== Test objective == 

	Show that the robot can interact with and manipulate newly learned dynamical(!) objects by simply giving them a name.

== Novelty and Scientific / League Contribution ==

    - Peform tasks without needing hard-coded environment knowledge besides the location of the walls.
    - Incremental learning / segmentation bootstrapping (the more you know, the easier it gets).
    - Automatically find the best pose to approach an object.
    - This experiment can instantly be repeated:
		* for every furniture layout of this arena.
		* for all objects (within detectable resolution)
 

== Test description == 

	AMIGO enters a new environment of which only the wall locations are known. A human operator uses a gui to send AMIGO around the room. All unknown objects can be labeled by the operator by simply clicking them and giving them a name. These objects are automatically extracted from the depth data and a 3D models is generated and added to the world model. Even adding unknown objects on top of (now) known objects is no problem (e.g. a cup on a table).
	
	Now to demonstrate this ability the operator sends AMIGO to locations by voice commands (e.g. drive to table). Using a constrained-based planner the best location to approach this object is determined (note the green arrows on the screen).
	
	Note that moving the objects while doing any of this is not a problem!
	
	The demonstration ends with a request to AMIGO to grab one of the learned objects and put it in the trash bin. (Sjoerd: "Again, moving these objects is no issue." unfortunately, this is not true :( ... ) Neither the object nor the thrash bin was known to AMIGO upon entering the room.
