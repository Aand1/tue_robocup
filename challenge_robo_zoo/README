Amigo is a bartender. He wants to get as many tokens as possible and thus he hands out drinks.
There are 4 main positions: 
 - storage table, where he gets new, full drinks.
 - These are brought to the ordering table, where people can get their drinks
 - pickup table, where people dump their empty cans
 - trashbin, where amigo dumps the cans picked up at the pickup table

The locations must be defined in tue_knowledge/prolog/locations.pl
