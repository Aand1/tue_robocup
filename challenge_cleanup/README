WHAT IF IT DOESN'T WORK?
The clean-up challenge is dependent some knowledge. 
First of all, the knowledbe base (KB) must know where every type/class of object should be cleaned up to. 
This is done via the 'storage_class'-predicate: 
 'storage_class(can, trashbin)'. to state  that something of the can class should be stored at something of the class 'trashbin'.

The fact that some object objXXX in the worldmodel is an instance of class is asserted to the worldmodel via perception. 
It can be queried via the 'instance_of'-predicate.
Classes of objects can also be subclasses of another class, so you can state 'storage_class' for a general class like 'stuff': 'storage_class(stuff, desk)', 
and also state that, say, a 'rubiks'-cube is a subclass of 'stuff'. 
This way, the reasoner deduces that the 'storage_class' of 'rubiks' is 'desk'. 

Then, the KB also has to know where to find a 'desk' or 'trashbin'. 
The KB holds dozens of 'point_of_interest'-predicates, e.g. 'point_of_interest(robotics_testlab_A, _, trashbin1,         point_3d(6.22,   0.78,   0.8)).'
here, 'trashbin1' is the name of the point_of_interest. 
The KB also holds knowledge like 'instance_of(robotics_testlab_A, _, trashbin1, trashbin).', which states that trashbin1 is an instance of trashbin. 

The clean-up challenge python file defines all of its queries near the top of the file. 

TIP of the day: use 
$ rostopic pub /pocketsphinx/output std_msgs/String 'livingroom' --once; rostopic pub /pocketsphinx/output std_msgs/String '!!str yes' --once
to test the exec
