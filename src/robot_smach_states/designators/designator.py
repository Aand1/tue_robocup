"""Designators are intended to excapsulate the process of selecting goals and 
of marking them as finished or inachievable.

TODO: Build up a family of ever complexer Designators.
1. The simplest one only resolves to a single value at runtime.
2. A more complex one can be Iterable and has a .next()-method. 
    After next() is called, the designator resolves to a different value.
3. More complex is a designator that can be refined in several ways, 
    or which can add knowledge or annotations to their current value.
For each designator, some class decorator can be added that will cast the current value to an object of some type.
    This can be an Arm, a Point/Pose(Stamped), a class name for perception etc.

TODO: Designators can be combined. Eg. get the closest answers to a query relative to the outcome of some other designator. 
Eg. one designator the the look_at point and a designator for objects close to that look_at point.

TODO:
Designators can be refined by a user of it. That can be through a perception routine determining something, the answer to a question etc. 
This means that the query for it is extended with an extra conjunction, making the answers more specific, for example. 
Some variables in the query can also be made constants, as to make the query more specific and lock it.
There is also no reason why designators cannot be cooperation with each other, althoug this would make thing overly complicated"""
