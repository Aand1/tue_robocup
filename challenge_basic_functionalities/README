== TEST THE EXECUTIVE ==
- All basic functionalities will be tested one after another. For most cases, the robot returns to 0,0,0 to start the next part
- Put some objects on the second table (i.e., without the computer) for the pick-and-place demo.
- Make sure the thrashbin is placed correctly
- Testing avoid that is a bit difficult, since there is no space for detours in our testlab
- Current questions for what did you say:

-- Possible questions for now: ----------------------------------------------------------
-- What time is it? ---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- What is the answer to the ultimate question about life the universe and everything? --

It is possible to start the challenge at one of the other atomic actions. To this end, give an argument:
Pick and place: 	rosrun challenge_atomic_actions challenge_basic_functionalities.py 1
Avoid that:			rosrun challenge_atomic_actions challenge_basic_functionalities.py 2
What did you say?:	rosrun challenge_atomic_actions challenge_basic_functionalities.py 3
Before doing so, please make sure the robot is reset (arms, spindle, head) and is localized correctly

== OBSOLETE ==
- Put some objects on the cabinet expedit for the fetch and carry
- Try to be at least with two people for the find me and go over there
