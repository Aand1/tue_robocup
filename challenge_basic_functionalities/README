Unplug the network cable in amigo.
localhost:
    sshamigo3 #This will not work because amigo is unplugged

Preparation: 
    - Make sure the robot is in the starting position
    - Plug the network cable back in
    - The sshamigo3 will connect
    - type 'hear continue' in the sshamigo3 console.
    
During the challenge
    - Amigo drives to the dinner table to pick something up and put it back down and then says it will wait for 'continue' to be said.
    - During the next task it will navigate to several waypoints:
        - start
        - living room
        - wp3
        - wp2
        - wp3
        - wp2
    - At wp2 it will then ask three questions. Currently it only listens to three names which are Rein, Sjoerd and Janno
    - Finally it will move to the exit
    
After the challenge
    - Turn off the microphone!!! Otherwise the battery will drain
